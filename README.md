# Cypress-Backend-Automatio
Backend Project

This a basic login authenticator with positive and negative instances, who test on an automation login, some important to mention is that running Cypress on GitHub Codespaces can have issues due to missing dependencies, display server (Xvfb), or lack of GUI support. So this only can be runned on local for now
